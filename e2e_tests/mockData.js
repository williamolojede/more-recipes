  instructions: [
    'Slice the pork tenderloin open the long way. Spread the mustard, minced garlic and chopped olives in the roast. Sprinkle with salt and pepper all-over, to taste. Tie the loin at 1-inch intervals to shape evenly into a roll. Refrigerate and marinate loin for 24 hours.',
    'To Grill: Prepare grill for high heat.',

    'Grill the pork for about 20 minutes or until it has reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 C). Remove from heat and allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.',
    'To Bake: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).',
